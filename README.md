# archive_demo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project uses [Envied](https://pub.dev/packages/envied) for secure environment variable generation and storage.

1. Run `$ flutter pub get`

2. Create an .env file in the root directory of the project and add your API URL like so:

`API_LINK=<link.to.your.graphql.api>`

3. Run `$ dart run build_runner build -d`
